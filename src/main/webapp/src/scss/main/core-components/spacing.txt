Producer can use bootstrap 4 classes for spacing

https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/utilities/spacing/

margins: m{sides}-{size}
padding: p{sides}-{size}

Examples..

mb-2 = margin bottom 2 spacing units
m-0 = no margins
pt-3 = padding top 3 spacing units
p-1 = padding all sides 1 spacing unit

There are now 6 sizes (0-6). Additionally, x-axis (left/right) and y-axis (top/bottom) utils have been added:

my-2 = margin top & bottom 2 spacing units
mx-0 = no margins left & right
px-3 = padding left & right 3 spacing units

And, the spacing utils are responsive. The smallest xs breakpoint is implied when no breakpoint is used.

margins: m{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}
padding: p{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}
mt-md-2 = margin top 2 spacing units, on md (and up)
py-sm-0 = no padding top & bottom, on sm (and up)
